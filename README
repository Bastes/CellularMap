=Two dimensional cellular map

This gem helps creating unbounded two-dimensional cellular maps.

==Map

Generating a map is as easy as it sounds :
 map = Map::Map.new

You can put things in the cells directly through the map :
 map[12, 7] = :whatever

==Cell

Cells are accessed through the [] method :
 cell = map[-1, 5]

A cell have content :
 cell.content
 cell.content = "something"
(an empty cell's content is nil)

Move from one cell to the other using coordinate vectors simply like this :
 cell + [0, 5]
 cell - [-8, 9]

==Zone

Zones are also accessed through the [] method, using at least one range for
boundary :
 zone = map[0..7, 18..29]
 zone = map[5, -1..6]
 zone = map[-4..-2, 3]

A zone allow pretty much the same kind of access to cells and other zones as
maps, but the coordinates are relative to the lower coordinates of the zone
instead of the map's :
 zone = map[1..4, 3..7]
 cell = zone[0, -8]
 # same as : cell = map[1, -5]
 other_zone = zone[10..12, 9]
 # same as : zone = map[11..13, 16]
